# Presenting the Danish National Archives' Concept Model for Development of Preservation Plans

## Introduction
The Concept Model enables an archive to develop preservation plans for content types and file formats in a methodical and documented approach. It provides several steps to complete involving

* Screening and Priority List
* Pre-analysis
* Migration Assessment
* Format Assessment
* Testing
* Consequence Assessment
* and finally the drafting of a preservation plan

To support the completion, guides for each step and templates are provided. We present the Concept Model in an English translation from Danish and we kindly ask you to bear this in mind when reading. The translations have been made to support international dissemination of the model.

The purpose of presenting the Concept Model publicly is to transparently publicize our internal methods and contribute to the field of digital preservation. Furthermore, we seek to enable discussions on the methods presented and encourage any Issues to be raised for us to consider.
