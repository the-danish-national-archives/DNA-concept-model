## 1. Introduction
Screening of a content type serves the purpose of determining what should happen when your archive, through various channels, come across problematic data, where it is presumed the data cannot be immediately converted to one or more of your preservation formats. Screening involves the following items 2-4.

## 2. Investigate content type
The scope of the investigation should be determined with relevant experts in your archive e.g. it should clarified if the investigation concerns a content type or only a specific file format.

Investigation involves:
•	Conduct meeting with relevant experts concerning the problem
o	Contact and conduct a meeting with relevant experts. Clarify possible issues regarding the problem and inform them of your further process for the investigation.
•	Possibly, interview one or more data producers concerning their use case.
o	Contact and conduct meeting with a data producer concerning their use cases for creation, usage, submission and reuse of the content type. Apply the questionnaire in Appendix 1 or develop your own questionnaire in advance of the meeting.
•	Delimit the content type
o	Identify and delimit the content type based on the data producer’s use case. Determine whether the content type is already in the Priority List.
•	Briefly describe the significant properties and file formats of the content type
o	Describe the file formats typically used within the content type and which significant properties and corresponding use cases, that these file formats support.

## 3. Recommend preservation solution
Based on previous steps, an assessment of whether data immediately can be migrated with acceptable loss and submitted in one or more of your archive’s preservation file formats must be made.
* The assessment must address whether data can immediately be migrated to a suitable preservation format by application of an existing migration tool. 

The screening assessment must result in one of the following recommendations:
* A. It is our assessment that data in the content type or specific format can always be submitted in existing preservation formats. If relevant, notify the data producer.
* B. It is our assessment that data in the content type or specific format can always be submitted in existing preservation formats, but we also assess that the data are migrated with loss to an extent, which should be investigated further. Register the content type or specific format on the Priority List and if relevant notify the data producer.
* C. It is our assessment that data in the content type or specific format cannot be submitted in existing preservation formats with acceptable loss. The content type or specific format must be registered on the Priority List.

### 3.1. Preservation level
The recommendation of preservation solution must be followed by a recommendation of preservation level. The recommendation must be given on the basis of a consideration of what is best to do under the current circumstances and available resources. The recommendation is a specific instruction for how to manage the data. The recommendation should be negotiated with relevant experts and managers in your organization.

One of the following preservation levels is suggested:
1. Keep at data producer or other institution (postpone submission or use proxy archive)
	* Negotiate agreement
2. Submit original data
	* Recommend a minimal solution where only copies of original data are submitted
3. Migrate to existing or temporary preservation format
	* Instruct preservation solution compliant with legislation

### 3.2. Preservation plan
A preservation plan must be produced. Describe the content type, preservation level, its file formats and how the content type should be managed and register information for the specific file formats and how to preserve these. See Appendix 3.

If recommendation C was reached, then the preservation plan may be reformulated as a result of conducting the full Concept Model investigation.

## 4. Collate information in screening report
The information gathered during the screening items 2-3 must be collated in a screening report, which are approved by management and sent to relevant caseworkers handling the submission.

Proposed disposition for screening report:
1.	Summary
	1.	Briefly describe the background, challenge and conclusion
3.	Screening of [insert name of content type]
  1.	See item 2 for content
3.	Recommendation of preservation solution
  1.	See item 3 for content
4.	(Possibly) Appendix: Preservation plan (if preservation level 1-3)
  1.	Describe the preservation of the content type
  2.	Insert filled templates for file formats
5.	(Possibly) Appendix: Priority criterias (if preservation level 4)
  1.	Insert filled template from Appendix 2

Case filing of the screening report should happen separately under the name “Screening of [insert name of content type]”. Here also relevant information from mails and the data producer’s notification should be registered.

Preservation plans for individual file formats must be copied into “Table_Preservation plans for data formats”.

## Appendix 1: Example of questionnaire for screening interview
Questions to data producer when screening content type and recommending preservation level.

1. Tell us about yourself and your organization
2. Why do you produce data of this content type? What is the purpose?
3. How many files of the content type do you have, and how large is their total size in TB?
4. How large a percentage of your total data, does the content type fill? Both quantity and TB.
5. Which file formats do you store the content type in?
6. How important is it for future reuse, that data are preserved in their original formats?
7. Which properties are important to preserve?
	1. Which properties for capturing the content of data are important?
	2. Which properties for rendering data are important?
	3. Which properties for the context of data (metadata) are important?
	4. Which properties for the structure of data (e.g. linked files and folders) are important?
	5. Which properties for the linking of relationships (e.g. external files and information) are important?
8. Do you think, the content type can be immediately converted to one or more of our preservation formats?
9. Which file formats would you recommend to preserve the content type in, so they can be reused in e.g. 50 years from now?

## Appendix 2: Template for registering content type in Priority List
Assessment of priority criterias must include a reason given to the clarifying questions listed in the table below. Conduct meeting with relevant colleagues to determine assessment.

The information must then be registered in the Priority List. The assessment contributes to forming a uniform decision basis for prioritizing the investment of analytical resources in developing new preservation plans for content types.

*Table 1: Template for assessing priority criterias*



## Appendix 3: Template for preservation plan
Fill the template separately for every file format, which the report has screened.
